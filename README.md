ArturBot is made for fun, as sometimes you need to switch one programming to another one
Hey my friend, Commands I have for now:
!@changeAva
!@isTheBest <name>
!@number //Guess my number in range of [0, 99]
->!@number <your number> //replies you if number is bigger or smaller
->!@number new //new game
!@match <name1> <name2> [any optinal args]
!@happy-birthday <name>
!@autoreply //everytime anyone mentions your in the message, bot replies with default message 
->!@autoreply <on/off> //changes your autoreply status
->!@autoreply <on/off> <your message> //updates autoreply status and sets messages to provided
->!@autoreply <your message> //changes your autoreply message and sets status to \"on\"
!@meme //sends a meme from local storage
->!@meme //if picture is attached to the message it will be saved to the local storage
->!@meme <direct link to an image> //donwloads image from web into the storage, supports many links separated by single SPACE
prefix love //returns how much love u need
//Now you can server mute and kick another user from the voice channel...Magic
There is 5 conditions you need to keep in mind:
1)Server is magic enabled
2)You have a magic licence
3)You have enough mana
4)Skill you using is not in CD
5)User which is your target has a magic licence as well
//Magic commands
[prefix]magic <on/off> <Your magic name> //to get a licence
[prefix]k <tag user/users> //to kick user/users from the voice channel
[prefix]m  <tag user/users> //to server mute user
[prefix]um   <tag user/users> //to unmute user
[prefix]clean //cleans 1-100 last messages not older than two weeks
[prefix]room_for_user <name of the voice channel> //when user enters this channel bot creates a separate voice channel, moves him/her to the new room, if room ends on \"s room\" and has no users in it bot deletes the room
[prefix]alarms <number of hours> <number of minutes> [you message(optional)] use it in direct messages, bot sends you in DM your custom message or default message every <number of minutes> during some <number of hours> you mentioned
[prefix]create_room <Name of channel (case sensitive)>
